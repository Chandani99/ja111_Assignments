Tight Coupling ->
=====================
In Tight Coupling we should know about other objects and are usually highly dependent on each other's interfaces. 
Changing one object in a tightly coupled application often requires changes to a number of other objects. 
In a small application we can easily identify the changes and there is less chance to miss anything. 
But in large applications these inter-dependencies are not always known by every programmer or there is a chance of overlooking changes. 


Loose Coupling ->
=====================
Loose coupling is a design goal that seeks to reduce the inter-dependencies between components of a system with the goal of reducing the risk that changes in one component will 
require changes in any other component. 
Loose coupling is a much more generic concept intended to increase the flexibility of a system, make it more maintainable, and makes the entire framework more "stable".
