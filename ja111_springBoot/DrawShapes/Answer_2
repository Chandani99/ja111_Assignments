Answer 1:
====================================
--> Spring IOC is a container and a framework for implementing automated dependency injection. 
--> It contains object creation for the longer ways to use and injects dependencies within the class. 
--> The IoC container constructs an object of the selected class and also injects all the dependency objects 
    via a constructor, a property, or a function at execution time and disposes it at a suitable time. 
--> This approach helps to create and manage objects manually.

Uses ->
--> IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework.
--> It is used to creates the objects, configure and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. 
--> It uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application.
